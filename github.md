## GitHub Nice Features

### Pull Request

This has a nice web page in a format like a forum discussion post where you can write a summary of your commits that you wanted to request to be merged. Other team members can comment on your post. Markdown is supported. A very nice way to let other people check/review your code and document their suggestions.

### Blame

[Example blame history](https://github.com/InCodeLearning/git-github/blame/master/github-workflow-homework.md). Comparing to `history`, which shows the exact change of each commit on the file, `blame` shows the current file and label each section with the corresponding commit. Hence, you can blame the bad code/text on an exact commit.
