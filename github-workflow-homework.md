## Github Work-Flow Homework

1. Create a repo in your github account and then create a `dev` branch off from `master` branch. Do some commits on `dev` branch and push it to github.
2. Create a branch off from `dev` branch **(note important: not from `master` branch)** with your own name as the branch name.
3. Do edits and some commits in your own branch and push to github.
4. Create a pull request (PR), merging from your own branch into `dev`. Stop here and we will have a video/voice google hangout session to test that you fully understood the workflow. Send Jesse the link of your testing repo.
5. Merge the PR on the command line.

### Actual workflow:

1. Make sure you are on your own branch git branch, create your own branch from `dev` if your branch not yet exists.
2. Merge `dev` into your branch `git merge dev`.
3. Do your edits and commits.
4. Create pull request (PR) merging from your own branch into `dev` branch.
Do more commits if you would like to. The later commits would be automatically included in the PR.
5. Every week we will take turns do merging everyoneâ€™s branch into `dev`.
6. **ONLY Jesse can merge from `dev` to `master`.**
